# End-to-End Lakehouse Architecture

## 1. Business context

This project simulates a retail organization struggling with fragmented data across finance and operations, slow reporting cycles, and limited analytics scalability. The objective was to design a Lakehouse architecture that delivers trusted, analytics-ready data for faster and aligned decision-making.

---

## 2. Challenges

• Multiples data sources

• Finance and operations don’t report the same numbers

• Reports are produced too late

• Operations data are difficult to use / not easily actionable

• IT is constantly in firefighting mode

• 80% time on data prep

• Slow query performance

• No self service capability

---

## 3. Data-driven solution

To address these challenges, the solution focuses on separating ingestion (Bronze Layer), data quality (Silver Layer), and business modeling concerns (Gold Layer), ensuring both reliability for IT and usability for business teams.

### 🥉 Bronze Layer 
- Raw data ingestion  
- Schema inference and storage as Delta tables  

### 🥈 Silver Layer
- Data cleaning and standardization  
- Type casting and validation  

### 🥇 Gold Layer
- Dimensional Data Model (Business Transformation)
- Ready for BI and analysis

## 4. Techical Decisions

- Lakehouse over traditional DWH to combine scalability, cost efficiency, and advanced analytics 
- Delta Lake for ACID transactions, time travel, and reliable incremental processing  
- Medallion architecture to decouple raw ingestion from business logic  
- Star schema in Gold to maximize BI performance and enable true self-service  
- Unity Catalog to enforce governance, lineage, and access control from day one

## 6. Expected Business Impact

• 80% Times saving
(analysts now focus on insights instead of SQL gymnastics)
• Self-service Enabled
(Business users create theirs own reports from the star schema)
• 10x Query time performance
• Isolated analytics workload
(Analytics workload runs on Lakehouse, not on operational system)
• Accurate numbers, faster closing cycles
• Governance embedded from day one
• Aligned decision-making enabled by a single source of truth

## 7. What i would do differently in a production environment

• Introduce incremental ingestion and CDC instead of full loads
• Add observability (job failures, data freshness, usage metrics)
• Extend governance with domain-based access control and data contracts
• Add data quality checks and SLA monitoring (e.g. expectations, alerts)
• Optimize cost via cluster policies and workload isolation
• Implement CI/CD pipelines for notebooks and data transformations ...
